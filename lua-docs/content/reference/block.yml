description: |
    A `Block` represents one block in a [Shape] or [MutableShape] (like the [Map]).

    A `Block` can be built with one of the [constructors](/reference/block#constructors), but it can also be obtained from a [Shape] or [MutableShape] with [Shape.GetBlock](/reference/shape#functions-getblock) or [MutableShape.GetBlock](/reference/mutableshape#functions-getblock).

    ⚠️ A `Block` obtained from an immutable object (like [Shape]) is in fact `read-only`, none of its properties can be set in that case.

constructors: 
  - description: |
      Creates a `Block` with `{0,0,0}` coordinates. ([Block.Position](#property-position))

      [Block.PaletteIndex](#property-paletteindex) is set to `paletteIndex`, but [Block.Properties](#property-properties) remains [nil] before the block is added to a [MutableShape] (owns the [Palette]).

    arguments:
    - name: "paletteIndex"
      type: "integer"
  - description: |
      Creates a `Block` with `{x,y,z}` coordinates. ([Block.Position](#property-position))

      [Block.PaletteIndex](#property-paletteindex) is set to `paletteIndex`, but [Block.Properties](#property-properties) remains [nil] before the block is added to a [MutableShape] (owns the [Palette]).

          Block's palette index. (first index is `1`)

          Returns Block's [BlockProperties].

functions:
    - name: "AddNeighbor"
      description: |
          Adds a [Block], adjacent to the face passed as parameter.

          Returns created [Block] (or [nil] if it fails).

          ⚠️ Won't work with `read-only` Blocks.

          A [BlockSelectMode] can be provided as an optional third argument. The default value is [BlockSelectMode.One](/reference/blockselectmode#property-one), with other modes the function always returns [nil], even on success.

      description: |
          Replaces the `Block` with the one passed as parameter. The position remains the same, [Block.PaletteIndex](#property-paletteindex) is the only property being set.

          `block:Replace(otherBlock)` actually has the same effect as `block.PaletteIndex = otherBlock.PaletteIndex`

          ⚠️ Won't work with `read-only` Blocks.
