          Hides an object for the local camera only. Other players will still be able to see it if `object.IsHidden` remains `false`.

          It's usefull when implementing a first person camera for example, to hide local player's body parts.

          Casts a ray and returns an [Impact] (can be [nil]).

          The [Impact] contains information about the kind of thing that's been hit.

          💡 Calls [Ray].[Cast](/reference/ray#functions-cast) under the hood. See [Ray].[Cast](/reference/ray#functions-cast) definition for more details about possible filters.
      samples:

            if impact.Block ~= nil then
              print("block hit:", impact.Block)

          Puts Camera in "first person" mode. Looking at the world from `target`'s perspective.

          When calling `SetModeFirstPerson` without parameters, the target defaults to [Player] (local player).

          When `offset` is set to an [number], the offset is set on the vertical axis only, (`Number3(0, offset, 0)`)

        - code: |

          Puts Camera in "third person" mode. (looking at Camera's target, from a behind-the-shoulder perspective)

          When calling `SetModeThirdPerson` without parameters, the target defaults to [Player] (local player).

          By default, the Camera is placed beind its target. But it's then possible to change its [LocalRotation](#property-localrotation) to look at the target from a different angle.

          `minDist`, `maxDist` and `offset` settings are optional but can be provided to tweak positioning.

      samples:
        - code: |
            Camera:SetModeThirdPerson()

            Camera:SetModeThirdPerson(someShape)

      description: |
          When in that mode, the camera rotates around its target, maintaining its distance from it.

          When calling `SetModeSatellite` without parameters, the target defaults the current position of the camera.

          `SetModeSatellite` can be called several time to update the `distance`.

          Once the "satellite mode" is set, [Camera.LocalRotation](#property-localrotation) can be used to rotate around the target.

      samples:
        - code: |
            Camera:SetModeSatellite(Player, 10.0)

    - name: "FitToScreen"
      description: |
          Fits the target to the screen.

          `screenRatio` indicates the percentage of the screen that should be covered by the target.

          When `spherize` is `true`, a sphere that contains the target is used to place the camera.
      arguments:
        - name: "target"
          type: "Shape"
        - name: "screenRatio"
          type: "number"
        - name: "spherize"
          type: "boolean"
      samples:
        - code: |
            local myShape = Shape(R.usename.myShape)
            Map:AddChild(myShape)
            Camera:FitToScreen(myShape, 0.6, false)
            -- the shape now covers 60% of the screen
