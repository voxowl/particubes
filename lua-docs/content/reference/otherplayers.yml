      [OtherPlayers] is an array of [Player]s that contains all players except the local one.
    
      [OtherPlayers] is not available to the [Server], because it just wouldn't make sense! 🙂

      [Player]s are indexed by their "player ID". Player IDs range from 0 to 15.

  - code: |
      for id, player in pairs(OtherPlayers) do
        print(id, player.Username)
      end
