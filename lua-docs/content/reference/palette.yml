    A `Palette` is a list of [BlockProperties] entries describing the visual properties of its owner [Shape]'s blocks.
    
    The entries of a palette can be changed at runtime with a few specific caveats:
    - only colors that are unused by the shape can be removed from its palette,
    - changing a color from opaque to/from transparent will require a call to `shape:RefreshModel()` to be reflected on the existing shape blocks,
    - changing the [BlockProperties.Light] or [BlockProperties.Color]'s alpha values will only be reflected on the baked lighting after calling `shape:ComputeBakedLight` (as of 0.0.47, only relevant for [Map])
